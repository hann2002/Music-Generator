# Music Generation by GPT Model

## Description
Convert MIDI files to text and tokenize them as vocabulary. Train a GPT model from scratch for music generation and music sequence continuation.

## Human Evaluation
### Comparison with Random Music Generation
100% indicates a significant improvement in output after training.

### Identifying whether it is AI-Generated
There is an 82% probability that music generated by the trained model is believed not to be AI-generated. In comparison, genuine music segments are believed not to be AI-generated with an 86% probability, only slightly higher than the trained model.

## Dataset
